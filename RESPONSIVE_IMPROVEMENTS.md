## üìê Breakpoint System

### Mobile First Approach
```css

@media (max-width: 767px) { ... }

/* Tablet: 768px - 1023px */
@media (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px) { ... }

/* Desktop: 1024px - 1439px */
@media (min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1439px) { ... }

/* Large Desktop: 1440px+ */
@media (min-width: 1440px) { ... }
```

## üé® Fluid Design Principles

### Typography
```css
.responsive-h1 {
  font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 5vw, 2.5rem);
  line-height: 1.2;
}
```

### Spacing
```css
.responsive-section {
  padding: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 4rem) 0;
}
```

### Grids
```css
